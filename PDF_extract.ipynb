      "Introduction \n",
      " \n",
      "Barclays developed a resolution plan as required by the Resolution Plan Final Rule1 (Final Rule) issued pursuant to Section 165(d) \n",
      " \n",
      "of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act2 (Dodd Frank Act).Section 165(d) and the Final Rule specify \n",
      "that foreign banking organizations defined as any foreign bank or company that is a bank holding company or is treated as a bank \n",
      "holding company under section 8(a) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA) that has $50.0bn or more in global, total \n",
      "consolidated assets is a covered company subject to the resolution plan requirements set forth in the Final Rule. Under the Final \n",
      "Rule, a covered company must submit a resolution plan annually that provides for the covered company's rapid and orderly \n",
      "resolution (as such term is defined in the Final Rule) in the event of the covered company's material financial distress (as such term \n",
      "is defined in the Final Rule) or failure. \n",
      " \n",
      "Effective resolution plans are an integral component of eradicating \"too big to fail\" for the largest global financial institutions. \n",
      "Resolution planning serves several important purposes, including: \n",
      " \n",
      "  Resolution plans can be incorporated as part of an institution's existing risk management framework, and the information \n",
      "collected in the resolution planning process can assist an institution in identifying and mitigating operational, credit and other \n",
      "risks so that the institution is less likely to fail;  \n",
      " \n",
      "  Resolution plans can enable financial institutions, working in close conjunction with their regulators, to assess their \n",
      "operations on a holistic level to determine whether there are appropriate operational changes that can be made to make \n",
      "institutions more resolvable in the event of failure;  \n",
      " \n",
      "  Using a hypothetical resolution scenario, resolution plans spotlight areas where cooperation among regulatory authorities \n",
      "across jurisdictions is required in order to facilitate an actual resolution of global financial institutions; and  \n",
      " \n",
      "  Resolution plans can make a large complex financial institution more resolvable by, among other things, providing an \n",
      "insolvency administrator or trustee necessary information about the institution's operations, including internal and external \n",
      "interdependencies and key infrastructure. \n",
      " \n",
      "Barclays PLC (BPLC), a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, is a bank holding company \n",

      " \n",
      "Regulatory and industry efforts have jointly contributed to a more stable financial system in recognition of the weaknesses \n",

      "central clearing for derivative trading and greater transparency relating to trading exposures through trade data repositories. \n",
      "Regulatory structures, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the US and the Financial Policy Committee and the \n",
